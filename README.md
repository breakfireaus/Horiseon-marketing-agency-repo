# Horiseon-marketing-agency-repo

## Description


- A marketing agency has asked me to refactor an existing site to make it more accessible.
- This project was built to give people more refactor an existing site to make it more accessible.
- web accessibility ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies like video captions, 
screen readers, and braille keyboards. 
- Accessibility is good for businessâ€”for one thing, accessible sites rank higher in search engines like Google. It also helps companies avoid litigation, which might arise if people with disabilities can't access a website.
- I got a better understanding of HTML and semantic elements
